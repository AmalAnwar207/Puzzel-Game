# Puzzel-Game

A Python-based interactive puzzle game designed to challenge players in logical thinking and problem-solving.

Features

A graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Tkinter for smooth user interaction.

Supports grids of sizes 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5.

Solves puzzles using advanced search algorithms such as:

Best First Search

Manhattan Distance heuristic

Number of Tiles Out of Place heuristic

Allows players to:

Shuffle tiles randomly.

Choose the grid size and solving algorithm.

View the time taken and number of steps required for solution.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Tkinter, NumPy, Queue

How to Run the Game
Clone the repository to your local machine.
